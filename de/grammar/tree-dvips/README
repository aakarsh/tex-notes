tree-dvips: There are three items in this package.  All files released
under the LaTeX Project Public License, version 1, or (at your option),
any later version.

1. CSLI postscript drawing macros.  Created by Emma Pease
(erpease at gmail dot com).  

latest update: May 16, 1995
version .91

These macros were originally created to draw the lines between nodes
in the trees created by the tree macros in lingmacros.sty.  They will
only work with dvips version 541 or later (by Tomas Rokicki available
on labrea.stanford.edu) but can be easily modified to be used with
earlier versions of dvips and slightly less easily modified for other
dvi to postscript convertors.

Problems:

Be wary of using page extraction programs such as dviselect as you may
accidently drop the special command loading the header file if you do
not include the first page.  dvips's own page selection commands will
keep the special.

If rotating, the nodeconnects should be included within the boundaries
of the \rotate command


2. CSLI linguistics macros (lingmacros.sty).  Created by various folk at
CSLI but maintained by Emma Pease.

3. The avm.sty file is a separate package created by Chris Manning
(manning@lcl.cmu.edu) while he was at csli.  It is included by
permission from him.


To install, place 

tree-dvips.pro

in the postscript header path for dvips. 

place the three .sty files where you put latex style files

Two things not included in this file but may be needed are
the squeeze program and rotate.sty.  Both are available with dvips.
